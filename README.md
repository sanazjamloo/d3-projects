# Data Visualization with D3

In this repository, I share my sample data visualizations with D3.js and Scalable Vector Graphics.

I learn and practice:

 * How web technologies like SVG, CSS, JS, HTML, and the DOM fit in the D3.js world.

 * The best way to get started on any visualization with non-D3 building blocks.

 * Creating and placing visual data elements using D3.js.

* Granular control of both data and aesthetics.

 * How to use AJAX and XMLHttpRequest to load data.
